For the three below you will have to use it in a regular chrome window. It will open in about:blank after you allow pop-ups.

**NEW!! EXTENSION DISABLER (NOT PATCHED)** 

1. Create a bookmark folder and paste the extension page lots of times. (About 800 minimum is recommended assuming your Chromebook is average school quality) It is recommended that you add the extension page at the beginning of the folder.

2. Right click and open all in a new window.

3. Close the window with all those tabs.

4. Open the folder in a new window again, and Chrome should hang those tabs to take care of the old ones in the background that were just closed. (Equivalent to the duplicate tab step in Bypassi's method)

5. Flip the Allow access to file URLs switch in the extension settings and then you've bypassed the patch and the exploit is working.

6. Close everything and you're good to go. If it didn't work, try adjusting the number of tabs being opened.
